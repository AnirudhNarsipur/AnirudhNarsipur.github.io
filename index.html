                        <p>
                            I'm currently based in the Bay Area after finishing
                            a Master's in Computer Science at Brown University.
                            Before this, I graduated with a B.Sc. (Honors) in
                            Computer Science-Mathematics from Brown. I received
                            the

                            At Brown, I was a member of the

                            at Brown where I was advised by

                            understand shell programs. You can find out more by

                            my main academic interest is in Computational
                            Biology. I was a member of the Fairbrother Lab at
                            Brown where I worked with Deep Learning models to
                            better understand splicing.

                            on building software infrastructure to deploy
                            SAT/SMT solvers at cloud scale as well as verifying
                            solver results using proof checkers.
