Hi, I'm Anirudh Narsipur. I'm a sophmore studying Computer Science and Computational Biology at Brown University. 

My academic interests lie in formal methods and the intersection of CS+Biology. In Fall 2021 I'm a teaching assistant for [Formal Proof and Verification](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs1951x/) where we use the theorem prover Lean to formalize mathematics and verify programs. 

In Spring 2022 I will be the Head Teaching Assitant for Logic For Systems which focuses on using SAT/SMT solvers to state and verify properties about systems.
