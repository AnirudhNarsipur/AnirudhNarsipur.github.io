Hi, I'm Anirudh.

I'm currently pursuing a fifth-year master's degree in Computer Science at Brown University. Before this, I graduated with honors from Brown,
with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I also received the [senior prize](https://awards.cs.brown.edu/2024/05/06/twenty-eight-students-win-2024-brown-cs-senior-prizes/) in Computer Science awarded to the top graduating seniors in the department. I'm a member of the [ATLAS research group](https://atlas.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown where I'm advised by Nikos Vasilakis. My work focuses on using formal methods to better understand shell programs. You can find out more by reading my [undergraduate thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GNCjBlvcHm7y81qqpyAtrOLwbjxKEiEC/view?usp=sharing). Apart from programming languages/formal methods, my main academic interest is in computational biology. I previously was a member of the Fairbrother lab at Brown where I worked with deep learning models to better understand splicing.

Outside of academia, I spent two summers interning at the [Automated Reasoning Group](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/automated-reasoning/) at Amazon Web Services (AWS). My work there focused on building software infrastructure to deploy SAT/SMT solvers at cloud scale as well as verifying solver results using proof checkers.

I'm currently looking for full-time job opportunities starting in the summer of 2025.

Feel free to send me an email! (You can find my email address on the left sidebar)
