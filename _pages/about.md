Hi, I'm Anirudh Narsipur. I'm a junior at Brown University. While I'm officially declared as a Mathematics-Computer Science major I'm deeply interested in Computational Biology.

My academic interests lie in formal methods and the intersection of CS,Biology. 

Some of the things I have done in the past are (You can find out more at my Resume): 

- In the summer of 2022 I worked at Amazon AWS in the Automated Reasoning Group building data benchmarking pipelines on top of AWS Resources to support ARG use cases. My internship project was deployed to production.

- I'm currently working in the Fairbrother lab at Brown where I'm using machine learning models to find discrepancies between laboratory models and actual biological systems. 

- In Spring 2022 I was the Head Teaching Assistant for [Logic For Systems](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1710)  which focuses on using SAT/SMT solvers to state and verify properties about systems.

- In Fall 2021 I was a teaching assistant for [Formal Proof and Verification](https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs1951x/) where we use the theorem prover Lean to formalize mathematics and verify programs. 

- In the Fall of 2020 prior to starting college I spent 2 months at Myraa Technologies building an Android app for on-device low resource keyword recognition.
