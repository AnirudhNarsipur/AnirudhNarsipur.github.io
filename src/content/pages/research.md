I will be presenting my work on static analysis for shell scripts at the [New England Programming Languages Symposium!](https://nepls.org/Events/34/)

I'm a member of the [ATLAS research group](https://atlas.cs.brown.edu/) at Brown where I'm advised by Nikos Vasilakis. I work on applying techniques from programming languages and formal methods to help developers better understand shell script. You can find out more by reading my [undergraduate honors thesis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GNCjBlvcHm7y81qqpyAtrOLwbjxKEiEC/view?usp=sharing). You can find the official submission on the [Brown CS Website](https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/ugrad/).
