title: 'Degree Requirements Checker (Python + SMT)'
description: "In collaboration with the CS departement I built a tool to check whether students satisfied the numerous requirements for a Brown CS major - something industry edtech software could not do. I developed this using the Z3 SMT solver. The tool is able to identify the combination of degree constraints that are violated as well as suggest possible courses satisfying requirements."
