title: 'Degree Requirements Checker (Python + SMT)'
description: "In collaboration with the CS department, I built a tool to check whether students satisfied the numerous requirements for a Brown CS major - something industry ed-tech software could not do. I developed this using the Z3 SMT solver. The tool can identify the combination of degree constraints that are violated and suggest possible courses satisfying requirements."
