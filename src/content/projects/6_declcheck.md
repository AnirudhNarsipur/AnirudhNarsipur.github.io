title: 'Degree Requirements Checker (Python + SMT)'
description: "Automatically check whether students satisfied the numerous requirements for a Brown CS major - something industry edtech software could not do. I developed this using the Z3 SMT solver in colloboration with the departement. The tool is able to identify the combination of degree constraints that are violated as well as suggest possible courses satisfying requirements."
